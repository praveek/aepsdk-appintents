## App Intents Framework

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents

The App Intents framework offers a programmatic way to make your app’s content and functionality available to system services like Siri and the Shortcuts app. The programmatic approach lets you expose any of your app’s capabilities, and not just ones that fall into specific categories. You also use this programmatic approach to supply metadata, UI information, activation phrases, and other information the system needs to initiate your app’s actions.

## Requirements

- App should target atleast iOS 16
